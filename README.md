# Shatale MCP Server

MCP server for [Shatale](https://shatale.com) — AI-native payment infrastructure. Give your AI agents the ability to make purchases, issue virtual cards, and manage spending within delegated budgets and policy controls.

**20+ tools** for the complete agent payment lifecycle: from merchant discovery to card issuance to purchase completion.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install and run

```bash
npx shatale-mcp-server
```

The server starts in **guest mode** with discovery tools. No API key needed to explore.

### 2. Get full access

npx shatale-mcp-server
```

Now you have **20+ tools** — full purchase flow, merchant catalog, user onboarding, card credentials, and sandbox testing.

## Example Prompts

Try these with your AI assistant:

- *"Search for electronics merchants in Germany"*
- *"Request a purchase of $49.99 at Amazon for user john@example.com"*
- *"Check the status of my last purchase"*
- *"Register a new user with email alice@startup.io and country US"*
- *"Create a test user and simulate a complete purchase flow"*
- *"What merchants are available in the travel category?"*
- *"Generate a spending policy for a procurement bot with $5000 monthly limit"*

## How It Works

```
AI Agent → MCP Server → Shatale API → Card Issuer → Visa/Mastercard
```

1. **Agent requests purchase** via `request_purchase` with merchant and amount
2. **Shatale evaluates policy** — checks delegation scope, amount limits, MCC rules
3. **User verifies** (if new) — opens personalized onboarding URL, confirms identity
4. **Virtual card issued** — issuing partner provisions a Visa card locked to the merchant and amount
5. **Agent receives credentials** — PAN, CVV, expiry via `request_temporary_credentials`
6. **Agent completes purchase** — uses card at the merchant

## Resources

- Local stdio transport — no network server exposed
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting
